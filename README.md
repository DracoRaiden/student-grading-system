Student Grading System

This project implements both Relative and Absolute grading systems for university-level courses. The main objective is to ensure fair, data-driven evaluation of student performance while adhering to HEC grading guidelines. Instructors can upload CSV/Excel files of raw scores, select their preferred grading method, and receive detailed statistics and visualizations.

Features

📥 CSV/Excel import of student marks

🎯 Absolute & Relative grading modes

📊 Descriptive statistical analysis (mean, std. dev., etc.)

📈 Visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn

🔍 Error handling and input validation
